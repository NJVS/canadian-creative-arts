### Home
 - The top of the homepage contains a hero section, with a full-size image background.
 - Next to the hero section is a floating box with event details in it.
 - The hero and footer section is bordered by an SVG curve implemented in the code, not
a PNG image.
 - You are free to decide how the rest of the page is coded, showcasing your knowledge.
 - Code should also be responsive to mobile devices.

### Registration
 - The registration page contains a 2-Step form, separated by tabs.
 - Copy the form fields and feel free to add Lorem Ipsum options for the select fields.
 - Each field should have error checking with Email, Date of Birth, Mobile fields only
accepting valid inputs.
 - All fields in Step 1 should be completed and validated before being able to click the Next
button and go to Step 2.
 - The fields in Step 2 are all select fields, but users should be able to select multiple
choices.
 - Code should also be responsive to mobile devices.

### Confirmation Page
 - When submitting the Registration page, the user should be directed to a confirmation
page. There is <strong>no mockup</strong> for this.
 - Create your own confirmation page and showcase your skills in CSS manipulation and
React.js.
 - Code should also be responsive to mobile devices.
